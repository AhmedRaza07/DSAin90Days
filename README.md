# DSAin90Days
Day 1:
Started with Space time complexity and am also taking web development lessons so it was great to start this 90 day thing. Loved the idea.
Day 2 :
It was a sunday mostly chilled and as I already knew a bit about space time complexity I didn't do it today and did some web dev instead. Gonna start with recursion from tomorrow. Good Night!
