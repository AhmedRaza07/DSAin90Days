# DSAin90Days
Day 1:
Started with Space time complexity and am also taking web development lessons so it was great to start this 90 day thing. Loved the idea.
Day 2 :
It was a sunday mostly chilled and as I already knew a bit about space time complexity I didn't do it today and did some web dev instead. Gonna start with recursion from tomorrow. Good Night!
Day 3:
The topic from day 3 to day 10 was recursion so, I was a bit familiar to the topic but it was a little rusty. Watched some youtube videos and solve a couple of basic qustions like sum of a list of numbers, fibonacci series, factorial etc. all using recursion. will continue tomorrow with comparitively more complex questions.
Day 4:
Was more of a sleepy day but did build some foundation over the topic. And the other half of the day was some work.
